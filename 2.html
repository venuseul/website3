<a href="https://www.leaderssys.com/"target="_blank" title="NVIDIA RTX 2080 SUPER">Venuseul</a> is a graphic design studio based in Korea,Seoul.<br>
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or differential programming) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised<br>
<p><p style="margin-top:20px">Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing,<br>
audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.</p>
